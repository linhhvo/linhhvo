🎓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently studying Digital Systems and Design at Aalto University.  
💻&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm interested in embedded programming, wearable technology, and mobile application development.  
💼&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a career-changer with previous work experience as a Business System Analyst and a Tax Accountant.

📚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I'm working on:<img src="/languages.svg" width="400" align="right">
  * Learning C++ and practicing with [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
  * Reading *Make: Electronics* by Charles Platt
  * Creating a new version for my personal website

💭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to work on next:
  * Learn microcontroller programming (just Arduino for now 😅)
  * Learn Kotlin
  * Develop a personal finance app to replace my current excel tracker
