🎓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently studying Digital Systems and Design at Aalto University.  
💻&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main focus is backend and Android development, with the occasional embedded programming.  
💼&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a career-changer with previous work experience as a Business System Analyst and a Tax Accountant.

🛠️&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I'm working on when not drowning in school assignments:
  * [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) with Go
  * Learn Kotlin
  * Creating a new version for my personal website

💭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things I’ll tinker with once I free up some brain cells:
  * Develop a personal finance app to replace my current excel tracker
  * Develop a plant care app
  * Learn more microcontroller programming

Other than technological interests, I also find joy in:
